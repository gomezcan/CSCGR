#### This folder contains all data row and process data, along with the list of TF used in this project. ########## 
1. Expression and co-expression data was collected from the ATTED-II database (versions Ath-r.v15-08 and Ath-r.c2-0, 
respectively)(Obayashi et al., 2018). In total, 1,416 different RNA-seq libraries were used with expression data 
associated to 25,296 different genes. Files: ExpressionData_link.txt and Ath-r.G25296-S1401.list.txt
2. Peaks files for all TFs analyses
3. Network file with TF and their corresponding target genes
4. BioGrid file with PPI used in the work (V3.5.169)
