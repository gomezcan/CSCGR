#This directory contains all raw data/input analyzed in this work

* 1. Expression and co-expression data was collected from the ATTED-II database (versions Ath-r.v15-08 and Ath-r.c2-0, 
respectively)(Obayashi et al., 2018). In total, 1,416 different RNA-seq libraries were used with expression data 
associated to 25,296 different genes Files links: Expression_Co-expression_Data_link.txt

2. Peaks files for all TFs analyses "PDI_files.bed.gz", link in PDI_files.txt file:
