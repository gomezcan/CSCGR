#### This folder contains all data row and process data, along with the list of TF used in this project. ########## 
1. Expression and co-expression data was collected from the ATTED-II database (versions Ath-r.v15-08 and Ath-r.c2-0, 
respectively)(Obayashi et al., 2018). In total, 1,416 different RNA-seq libraries were used with expression data 
associated to 25,296 different genes. 
2. Peaks files for all TFs analyses
3. Network file with TF and their corresponding target genes
4. BioGrid file with PPI used in the work (V3.5.169)
